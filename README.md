# odin-landingpage
Landing Page assignment from The Odin Project

This was a fun assignment to do, not particularly challenging after all the flexbox lessons and practice offered by the course, but satisfying to accomplish.

The process was simple, I just worked on one part at a time, first writing the html for one segment, then moving on to the css for that segment, committing, and moving on to the next one.

Most things ended up being divs, but I was mostly concerned with proper alignment and rarely did I ever want my elements to be inline. The page is also not responsive at all, but the course itself told us not to worry about it.

All in all quite satisfying and good practice.
